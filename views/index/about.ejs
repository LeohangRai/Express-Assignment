    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        This is a webapp created using the express library on Node js. The templating engine used in this webapp is Embedded Javascript Templates (EJS). In the users page, the json data from "users.json" file is loaded and shown in a table. We can add new users by going to the '/users/register' route. By doing so, the new user data will be saved in the "users.json" file. The Weather page uses the weather-stack API to fetch weather data for different locations of the world.
